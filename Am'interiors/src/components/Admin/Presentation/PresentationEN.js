            My name is amin and I present to you amâ€™interior, my small interior
            decoration company, which is there to support you and guide you in
            your future projects. I'm going to tell you about what I think has
            developed my love for beauty and aesthetics, I am Franco-Tunisian,
            born in Tunis and I have lived between these two wonderful
            countries, its two rich and enriching cultures, since I am a child I
            spent my time contemplating, analyzing and comparing my environment,
            it certainly developed my sense of observation and my interest in
            others, being a very contemplative person, I also spent my time
            observing what surrounded me, that is to say the objects, the
            furniture, the building and above all the light that enters the
            rooms, because I am very sensitive to light atmospheres, on a sunny
            day or a rainy day, for me everything that around was changing,
            looking at all this with interest also sometimes led me to wonder if
            such and such an object would not be better in another place or
            whereas an object of such and such a style would not sublimate it,
            and then I I started to coach my mother in her decoration then the
            family, then the are friends and of course I started to decorate the
            apartments in which I sometimes lived without much means, around me
            we recognized an ability to make a place warm and beautiful, because
            yes what I like is decoration warm or we feel good or we like to
            receive, or snuggle up in front of the TV, whether modern or old,
            when I think of a decorative axis I think of those who will live
            there or visit it, and especially how they will feel when they get
            there. Here I said a little about me, and now if you want to contact
            me, I can't wait to know more about you and your projects!!
